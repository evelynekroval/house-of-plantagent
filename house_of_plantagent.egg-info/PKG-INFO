# House of PlantAgent

A vegan/plant-based nutrition and cuisine agent powered by OpenAI 4o mini search preview, which includes real recipe retrieval.  
**(Less) hallucinated recipes—only. Real, web-sourced dishes.**

## Features

- Search for vegan recipes guided by Eleanor of Aquitaine (LLM persona).
- Retrieves recipes from the web, not model memory.
- User preferences (ingredients, cuisines, dislikes) drive results.
- Streamlit chat interface for easy interaction.

## Quick Start - Chat
