# House of PlantAgent

The project is a vegan / plant-based nutrition and cuisine LLM agent that:

- Does not generate recipes from model memory.

- Retrieves real recipes from predetermined online sources.

- Applies retrieval, filtering, and scoring based on user preferences (ingredients, cuisines, dislikes).

- Integrates nutritional analysis using open data sources, scraping, or offline ingestion pipelines.

- Keeps track of user's minimum nutritional needs for a "well-planned vegan diet".

- Demonstrates the user’s grasp of RAG, grounding, and agentic orchestration patterns.
