- Tool runs. Agent runs. That's great. [x]
- [ ] Issue is that they clearly don't pass information to each other. I _suspect_ the issue relates to context / runtime context, which I feel I've read about several times and I just don't grasp what the issue is.
- Okay, it does seem to work, but I'm noticing that it's best I restrict the websites it searches for so that I can control for these login popups which block the content. I've noticed that if I make the max_search = 2, it works better...
- I still believe I need to understand the following better:
    - [ ] Context
    - [ ] RuntimeContext
    - [ ] Tool Context?
- Idle thought but, might it be helpful to include the LangChain guidance straight into Copilot as they advised?
