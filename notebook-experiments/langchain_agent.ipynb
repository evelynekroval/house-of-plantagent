      "Total time: 45–55 minutes (including pressing tofu)\n",
      "Active prep: 15 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients\n",
      "\n",
      "Tofu and veggies\n",
      "- 14 oz (400 g) extra-firm tofu, pressed 15–30 minutes\n",
      "- 1.5 lb (680 g) baby gold or red potatoes, halved (or cut into 1-inch chunks)\n",
      "- 1 large head broccoli (about 4 cups florets/500 g)\n",
      "- 1 tbsp olive oil (for veggies; optional for oil-free: use veggie broth or aquafaba)\n",
      "\n",
      "Lemon-garlic marinade\n",
      "- 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice\n",
      "- 1 tbsp lemon zest (from 1–2 lemons)\n",
      "- 2 tbsp olive oil (omit for oil-free; add 1–2 tbsp vegetable broth instead)\n",
      "- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 tbsp maple syrup (or agave)\n",
      "- 2 tsp Dijon mustard\n",
      "- 1 tsp smoked paprika\n",
      "- 1 tsp dried oregano (or Italian seasoning)\n",
      "- 1 tsp fine sea salt\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper\n",
      "- Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dairy-free dill yogurt sauce\n",
      "- 3/4 cup (180 ml) unsweetened plain vegan yogurt (coconut, almond, or soy)\n",
      "- 2 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped (or 2 tsp dried)\n",
      "- 1 tbsp lemon juice\n",
      "- 1 small clove garlic, finely grated\n",
      "- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (optional for richness)\n",
      "- 1/4 tsp salt, to taste\n",
      "- Black pepper, to taste\n",
      "- 1–2 tbsp water to thin, if needed\n",
      "\n",
      "To serve (optional)\n",
      "- Lemon wedges\n",
      "- Extra dill or parsley\n",
      "- Capers for a briny pop\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Prep and preheat\n",
      "- Press tofu 15–30 minutes to remove excess moisture.\n",
      "- Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a large sheet pan with parchment for easy cleanup.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Make the marinade\n",
      "- In a bowl, whisk lemon juice, zest, olive oil, garlic, maple syrup, Dijon, smoked paprika, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Prep tofu\n",
      "- Slice pressed tofu into 8–10 “steaks” or cut into 1-inch cubes. Place in a shallow dish and spoon about 1/3 of the marinade over the tofu, turning to coat. Let sit while you prep veggies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Season veggies and start roasting\n",
      "- In a large bowl, toss potatoes with 1/2 of the remaining marinade plus 1 tbsp olive oil (or a splash of broth for oil-free).\n",
      "- Spread potatoes on the sheet pan and roast 15 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Add broccoli and tofu\n",
      "- Toss broccoli with the remaining marinade. After potatoes have roasted 15 minutes, push them to one side of the pan.\n",
      "- Add broccoli to the pan. Arrange marinated tofu on the remaining space. Spoon any leftover marinade from the tofu dish over the pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Roast until golden\n",
      "- Return pan to oven and roast 18–22 minutes, flipping tofu halfway through. For extra caramelization, broil for 2–3 minutes at the end. Potatoes should be tender, broccoli lightly charred, and tofu golden at edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Make the dill yogurt sauce\n",
      "- While roasting, stir together vegan yogurt, dill, lemon juice, grated garlic, olive oil (if using), salt, and pepper. Thin with water to a drizzly consistency. Adjust salt and lemon to taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Serve\n",
      "- Plate roasted potatoes, broccoli, and tofu. Drizzle with dill yogurt sauce and finish with lemon wedges, extra dill/parsley, and capers if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips and variations\n",
      "- Protein boost: Toss a drained can of chickpeas with a bit of marinade and roast alongside veggies.\n",
      "- Veg swap: Use asparagus, green beans, or cauliflower in place of broccoli (adjust roasting time: thin veg 12–15 minutes).\n",
      "- Spice it up: Add 1 tsp ground cumin or coriander to the marinade for a warmer profile.\n",
      "- Oil-free: Omit oils and use vegetable broth or aquafaba in marinade and for tossing veggies.\n",
      "- Make ahead: Marinade and press tofu up to 24 hours in advance. Sauce keeps 3–4 days refrigerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Storage\n",
      "- Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container up to 4 days. Reheat at 375°F (190°C) for 8–10 minutes, or pan-sauté to re-crisp tofu. Sauce keeps 3–4 days.\n"
